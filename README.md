# rpi_cnc_img
Create a non-intervention, plug and play RPi image for controlling an RPi driven cnc machine.

Initial ideas:

1) Need an image writer. Options are:
  Pi Bakery

  http://blog.kmp.or.at/2012/05/build-your-own-raspberry-pi-image/
  https://github.com/andrius/build-raspbian-image
  https://github.com/b-s101/build-raspberrypi-image

2) Method to easily get the RPi's IP address:
  16x2 LCD display?
  small TFT LCD touchscreen display?
  manual search on main computer, using arp -a etc?
  audio blast from RPi on first startup?
